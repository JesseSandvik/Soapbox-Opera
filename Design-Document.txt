Soapbox Opera Design Document

Overview

Generic User A needs a way to chat with Generic User B about generic user stuff. Super important.

That's it.

Super important stuff between big important people. Gotta be real-time.

    1. CRUD for USERS
    2. CRUD for CONVERSATIONS

GUI Requirements:
    1. register username/password
    2. user list
    3. conversation view
    4. input field for message to be sent
    5. Log in/Log Out


Websocket. I'm making a websocket, using TypeScript, React for client, Node.js for REST API server. Both familiar technologies so I can develop this quickly.
This project is going to be small, I'm not developing it beyond a basic chat feature. I'm opting for a non-relational database (MongoDB) to make this quick and dirty.
I can't imagine ever needing to query the data from this app for anything, and I don't plan on bothering with caching on the server-side to improve the read speed
drawbacks of relational databases systems. If I bother with testing for this exploratory build, I'll go with Jest/React Testing Library for the client, and Jest for
the server. Both libraries are familiar to me and will help keep development time to a minimum.


Cool, bye.
